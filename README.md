# blockchain demo
I watched the 3b1b video and wanted to try it just to see if it's that simple.
While this is an extremely simplified version of a blockchain implementation,
I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that everything I saw in the video
was implementable here.

## What's next?
I'm gonna test it and play around with it just to see where I left null
pointers and after that, but after that I might try to write a merkle tree in
Java, again just because I'm curious to see what it's like.
